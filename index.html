        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
          I am a Director of IT at UBS with over two decades of experience spanning infrastructure testing, quality assurance,
          operations, and service delivery across global enterprises. I’ve grown through hands-on technical roles into leadership
          positions where I drive strategy, oversee complex implementations, and partner with business stakeholders to deliver
          measurable outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
          My background combines financial services, consulting, and technology operations, including leadership roles at UBS,
          Cognizant, HP, and engagements with clients such as Wright Medical Technologies. I am passionate about building resilient
          systems, enabling teams to perform at their best, and continually improving processes through automation and DevOps
          practices.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also invest in communication and leadership skills through roles with Toastmasters International and professional
          engineering associations, reflecting my focus on both technical and human aspects of IT leadership.
